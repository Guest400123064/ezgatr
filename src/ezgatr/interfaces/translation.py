    We use the convention that translations are represented by the ``xyz`` coordinates

    Parameters
    ----------
    positions : torch.Tensor
        End positions of the translation vectors with shape (..., 3).

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Multi-vectors with PGA representation; tensor of shape (..., 16).
