def decode(mvs: torch.Tensor, eps: float = 1e-6) -> torch.Tensor:
    r"""Extract 3D points from multi-vectors with PGA.

    One needs to divide the coordinates by the homogeneous coordinate to obtain
    the 3D points. In this case, to prevent numerical instability, we set a threshold
    to the homogeneous coordinate, so that the division will only be performed when
    the absolute value of the homogeneous coordinate is above the threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mvs : torch.Tensor
        Multi-vectors with PGA representation; tensor of shape (..., 16).
    eps : float, default to 1e-6
        Minimum value of the additional, un-physical component. Necessary to avoid
        exploding values or NaNs when this un-physical component of the homogeneous
        coordinates becomes too close to zero.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        3D points with ``xyz`` coordinates; tensor of shape (..., 3).
